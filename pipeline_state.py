"""Shared pipeline state for Mod3 reflex arc.

Thread-safe bridge between inbound (VAD/microphone) and outbound (TTS/playback)
pipelines. Enables sub-50ms interrupt: VAD detects user speech -> interrupt() ->
player.flush() -> silence, without waiting for the LLM round-trip.

Usage:
    state = PipelineState()

    # Outbound side (TTS thread)
    state.start_speaking("Hello world", player)
    state.update_position(samples_played, total_samples)
    state.stop_speaking()
