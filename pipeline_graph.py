"""Channel pipeline-as-composable-graph — stage registry and mode defaults.

This module implements Primitive 4 of the substrate channel primitive design.
The pipeline is a declared composable stage graph with a ChannelMode field
that switches between two compositions:

  INTENTIONAL (default):
    mic → denoise → vad → stt → emit
    Session-scoped, explicit participation. The user turns the mic on
    deliberately. This is the current default for all Claude Code / MCP
    channels.

  AMBIENT:
    mic → denoise → vad → diarize → ecapa_match → stt → attribute →
    mention_detect → emit
    Always-on mic, VAD-gated attention, continuous diarization. Cog listens
    without responding unless mentioned or "appropriate silence" is detected
    (OQ-5, per Chaz's May 17 transcript). This is the multi-human-attendee
    mode (e.g. Chaz + Erin with a hot mic).

Stage registration:

  Use the ``@register_stage(name)`` decorator on any class that implements a
  pipeline stage. The InboundPipeline will instantiate registered stages by
  name when composing a pipeline.

  Stages listed in DEFAULT_PIPELINES that are NOT registered are silently
  skipped with a warning log. This means ambient mode is safe to declare
  today — the unregistered stages (diarize, ecapa_match, attribute,
  mention_detect) produce substrate-visible TODO warnings until their
  implementations land in follow-on PRs.

No side effects on import.
