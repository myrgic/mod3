"""Regression tests for §4 of ARCHITECTURE.md — STT executor isolation.

Before the fix: _process_utterance(), _run_t1(), and _run_t2() all called
``await asyncio.to_thread(_transcribe_*)`` which submits work to the
asyncio default thread pool.  That pool is shared with bus.act() drain
threads and other I/O helpers.  A 1-2s mlx_whisper.transcribe() call holds
one pool slot for its full duration — starving concurrent bus.act() jobs
under load.

After the fix: all three STT calls route through
``loop.run_in_executor(channels._STT_EXECUTOR, ...)`` where
``_STT_EXECUTOR`` is a dedicated ``ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)``
owned by the channels module.  The default pool is left free.

Tests
-----
1. ``test_stt_uses_dedicated_executor`` — verify the executor used for a
   simulated _process_utterance call is ``_STT_EXECUTOR``, not the default.
2. ``test_slow_stt_does_not_block_default_pool`` — a slow STT job does not
   prevent a concurrent task that uses the default pool from completing
   within its expected window.
3. ``test_shutdown_stt_executor_is_safe`` — shutdown_stt_executor() returns
   without error when called with wait=False (used in teardown paths).

Run: python -m pytest tests/test_stt_executor_isolation.py -v
