# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Dashboard session switching + chat persistence across refresh

- **Per-session chat history.** New `message_store.py` keeps a per-session ring buffer (default 500 messages) of `{id, session_id, role, content, input_type, ts}` records. `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/messages`, `POST /v1/sessions/broadcast-message`, and `POST /v1/dashboard-chat` all append into the store under the resolved session id; broadcasts without a target attribute fall back to the `"main"` session. New endpoint `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/messages?limit=N` (default 100, max 1000) returns the recent slice for hydration. RAM-only; restart wipes the buffer (parity with seats / SessionRegistry / chat-flow log).
- **Sidebar click selects the active chat session.** The sidebar click handler in `dashboard/index.html` is no longer a stub — clicking a session row sets `window.__activeChatSessionId`, persists it to `localStorage.mod3.activeChatSession`, calls `acpTransport.sessionResume(sid)` when ACP transport is available, fetches `GET /v1/sessions/<sid>/messages`, and re-renders the chat pane. Outbound sends from the chat input now route to the active session by default (explicit `@<sid>` mentions still win); when the active session is the dashboard's own, the local AgentLoop continues to handle the reply.
- **Refresh hydration.** On page load, after the dashboard's own session registers, the active chat session is restored from `localStorage.mod3.activeChatSession` (falling back to the dashboard's own session_id when nothing is saved). The chat pane re-renders from `GET /v1/sessions/<sid>/messages` so a page refresh no longer drops the conversation. The dashboard's own participant identity (`localStorage.mod3.sessionId`) is unchanged by the active-session selection — switching sessions only changes what this tab is *sending to*, not who it *is*.

### Fixed — Dashboard sidebar enumerates seat-bearing sessions

- **Mirror seat-bearing sessions into SessionRegistry.** `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/seats` now idempotently registers the session in the voice-TTS `SessionRegistry` after the seat lands. Before this fix only the startup-seeded `"main"` session showed up in `GET /v1/sessions`; Claude Code channel clients bound to their own session UUID per PR #103 were attached at `/v1/sessions/{id}/seats` but invisible to the sidebar, which reported "No active sessions" with a live channel client. `SessionRegistry.register` preserves existing voice allocation on repeat calls, so multiple seats under the same session_id don't reshuffle the voice. Mirror failures log a warning and never break seat registration.

### Added — Dashboard ↔ Claude Code channel binding

- **Bind mod3 seats to the real Claude Code session_id.** Each Claude Code session now registers a distinct channel-client seat instead of all sessions collapsing into the legacy `"main"` sentinel. `clients/channel_client.py` reads `~/.claude/sessions/<parent-pid>.json` at startup to discover the harness session_id; the kernel's `/v1/claude-code/spawn` flow continues to pass `--session <id>` directly via a temp `.mcp.json`. Dashboard `sessions.html` posts `mod3:claude-code-spawned` (same-origin) to its opener after spawning; `index.html` listens, polls `/v1/sessions/<id>/seats` until the seat appears, then calls `acpTransport.sessionResume(session_id)` to bind its ACP connection. New `AcpTransport.sessionResume(sessionId)` method wraps the existing server-side `/ws/acp` `session/resume` handler. (#103)
- **Hotfix: state-file resolution.** `${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-main}` env-substitution in `mcp.channel.json` doesn't fire because that variable isn't in the parent claude process's env at MCP-spawn time. Replaced with `_resolve_claude_session_id()` walking up the parent PID chain to read Claude Code's own `~/.claude/sessions/<PID>.json` state file. (#105)
- **Hotfix: resolver polls for state file (startup race).** Claude Code writes its `~/.claude/sessions/<PID>.json` AFTER spawning MCP children — the resolver's one-shot check lost the race and fell back to `"main"`. Now polls with a 10s deadline + 100ms interval; PPID chain is snapshotted once. Live-fire test simulates a 200ms-late state file to catch regressions. (#106)
- **Hotfix: longer poll timeout + live-PID fallback.** Observed gap on this machine was ~35 seconds, not <10 — bumped `poll_timeout_s` default from 10s to 60s. Added a fallback that picks the most-recently-modified `~/.claude/sessions/*.json` whose PID is still alive (kill -0 check) when the parent-chain ancestry doesn't trace back to claude (bg-spare re-parenting / wrapper-script interposition). Liveness, not mtime, is the freshness signal — Claude Code only updates the state file on status changes. (#107)
- **Diagnostic: startup log at `~/.mod3/channel-client-startup.log`.** channel_client now writes a one-line entry on every launch with timestamp, pid, ppid, resolved session_id, and source (env / parent-chain / fallback / default). Auto-trims to last 200 lines. Lets operators post-mortem what the resolver picked — Claude Code captures the MCP child's stderr internally and it's not easily retrievable. Best-effort write; never raises. (#108)
- **Hotfix: parse `--resume <id>` from parent argv (placeholder rewrite bug).** Claude Code writes a *placeholder* session_id to `~/.claude/sessions/<PID>.json` at startup, then rewrites the file with the actual `--resume` target ~28 seconds later. The state-file resolver read the placeholder and registered the seat at the wrong session_id. Fix: walk the parent-chain looking for a claude process and parse `--resume <id>` from its argv first — argv is set at exec() and never changes, immune to the rewrite. Falls through to the state-file resolver for non-resume launches. (#109)

### Security

- **Pre-existing auth posture surfaced.** During review of #103, the security review flagged that `/v1/sessions/{id}/seats`, `/v1/sessions/broadcast-message`, and `/v1/claude-code/spawn` have no auth or CSRF protection. The findings predate this work (the localhost-only design assumed no untrusted browser context) but the dashboard wiring now exercises these endpoints from same-origin scripts. Phased mitigation tracked in #104.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added — Wave-6b session identity claims

- **`iss`/`sub` on seat registration** -- `register_session` now emits `presence.started` with issuer and subject fields set from the CogOS identity context. (#89)
- **Multi-identity harness binding** -- a single harness seat can now carry multiple identity claims (user + agent simultaneously); `seats.py` updated with `user_iss`/`user_sub` and `agent_iss`/`agent_sub` pairs. (#91)

### Added — Voice subsystem

- **`VoiceProfile` schema adoption** -- `voice_profile_schema.py` is the canonical schema layer; mod3 now reads voice config from CogOS identity projection events via `IdentityVoiceProfile`. `cog://voices/*` URIs are resolved to the local registry under `~/.mod3/voices/`. (#90)
- **URI resolver docstring fix** -- corrected stale comment on `resolve_voices_uri` that referenced the old field names. (#97)

### Added — Channel pipeline composability

- **`ChannelMode` + composable stage graph** -- `channels.py` introduces `ChannelMode` (passthrough / transcribe / agent) and a directed acyclic stage graph; pipeline stages are composed at startup rather than hard-wired. (#92)
- **`@register_stage` intentional stages** -- `inbound.py` extracts the intentional pipeline stages (VAD, STT, intent classification) into `@register_stage`-decorated classes so the stage graph can enumerate and wire them automatically. (#98)

### Added — ACP transport

- **`session/list`, `session/load`, `session/resume`, `authenticate`** -- the four missing ACP methods are now wired in `http_api.py`; mod3 is a conforming ACP server for session lifecycle. (#100)
- **Auto-create main session + `session/update` wire-shape fix** -- a `main` session is created at startup so clients can connect immediately; the `session/update` request shape now matches the ACP spec. (#101)

### Added — SSE bridge for identity-projection events

- **`/v1/events/identity-projection` SSE endpoint** -- `bus_bridge.py` wires a Server-Sent Events handler for CogOS identity-projection events so the dashboard and channel clients receive voice and identity updates in real time. (#99)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added — RTVI 1.3.0 audio-plane compatibility

- **`rtvi-client` seat type** — `VALID_CLIENT_TYPES` extended to accept RTVI 1.3.0 clients. (#75)
- **`/ws/audio/{session_id}` client-ready/bot-ready handshake** — RTVI protocol negotiation on WebSocket connect. (#77)
- **Raw-audio inbound routing** — `client-audio` frames routed to VAD/STT pipeline. (#80)
- **RTVI transcript and speaking-lifecycle emission** — `bot-speaking`, `bot-stopped-speaking`, and `transcript` server events emitted on the audio plane. (#78)
- **`disconnect-bot` graceful close** — server-side teardown on client disconnect-bot message. (#76)
- **Full-session RTVI 1.3.0 integration test** — T1–T6 coverage for the audio WebSocket path. (#81)
- **G2 executed decision record** — RTVI 1.3.0 B+ selected over LIVEKIT/Pipecat-native alternatives. (#79)

### Added — Smart Turn v3 end-of-utterance detection

- **Smart Turn ONNX v3.2-cpu vendor** — replaces v1 model; CoreML execution provider wired for both ONNX sessions on Apple Silicon. (#74)
- **Smart Turn v3 integration** — end-of-utterance detector replaces legacy silence-threshold heuristic. (#73)
- **`voice_confidence` wrapper** — shared confidence accessor for VAD and RTVI; decision doc + weight fetch (F2, F4). (#72)
- **Rung-1 Silero VAD + Smart Turn vendor scaffold + RTVI scoping doc** (F1, F3, G1). (#71)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-15

### Default voice

The CogOS-driven speech default is now `eng_uk_m_davids` (Chatterbox-Turbo cloned British male, "David S"). This replaces the prior default `bm_lewis`. Prosody is more natural under the Chatterbox-Turbo stack; the voice ID is stable and registered in the voice profile registry.

### Added — Channel architecture (ADR-082)

- **Session-aware communication bus** — sessions are first-class citizens on the event bus; per-session routing replaces broadcast fan-out. (#acad6f1)
- **ACP transport endpoint** — `/ws/acp` accepts connections from ACP-compatible clients and routes prompts through the kernel cycle via `cogos_agent_bridge`. (#31, #34)
- **Claude Code channel via separated channel-client** — dedicated channel-client module (supersedes the in-process bridge approach from #39). (#40)
- **Single-path channel routing** — removed superseded bridge, fallback, and mcp_shim layers; one canonical routing path through the bus. (#42)
- **ACP client e2e flow tests** and ACP-client pattern documentation. (#44)
- **Sessions browser** — dashboard UI panel showing ACP-client projects and sessions. (#43)
- **Echo suppression** — originating seat excluded from fan-out to prevent self-echo. (#45)

### Added — Dashboard surface

- **Three-column shell** — skeleton layout with sessions sidebar, main panel, and Settings / Traces / Debug side panel. (#d0ed93b)
- **Settings panel** — transport, voice, and audio controls in the settings tab. (#36)
- **Three-tab page nav** — Dashboard / Console / Voice Lab. (#33)
- **Real-time trace panel** — phase timeline with kernel sub-spans. (#56)
- **Hierarchical span tree** — agent-prism-inspired nested span display replacing the flat Gantt. (#a80d72a)
- **Debug tab bus event stream** — live bus events in the Debug tab. (#66)
- **Providers/available endpoint** — dynamic backend selector populated from `/providers/available`. (#ade87e8)
- **Accessibility and keyboard shortcuts** (Wave 3H+I). (#67)
- **Participant panel** and auto-register on page load. (#cff22f3)

### Added — Voice and TTS

- **Queue-aware `POST /v1/speak` endpoint** — HTTP counterpart to the `speak()` MCP tool; returns queue position, estimated wait, and active job state. (#54)
- **Voice profile registry** (Phases 1–3) — cloned voices as first-class voice IDs stored under `~/.mod3/voices/`; voice profile I/O, schema, and profile management. (#21)
- **Unified `output()` MCP tool** — single tool with `mode` ∈ `{audio, text, both}` dispatching to TTS, dashboard chat, or both simultaneously. (#55)
- **`bargein.event` with position tracking** — emitted on TTS interrupt with byte-level position so consumers know how much was spoken. (#57)
- **RTVI 1.3.0 audio envelope** for `/ws/audio/{session_id}` sidecar. (#29)
- **`/ws/audio/{session_id}` WebSocket** for per-session playback routing. (#69dd70d)

### Added — STT and open-mic

- **Continuous voice** — auto-start VAD, barge-in integration, and tunable endpointing for always-on mic capture. (#38)
- **Multi-strategy Whisper dedup** — Z-function, sentence-level, and N-way deduplication strategies to eliminate phrase doubling. (#53)
- **Dedicated STT thread executor** — isolates Whisper inference onto its own `ThreadPoolExecutor` to prevent blocking the async event loop. (#25)

### Added — Observability

- **Structured chat-flow log** — `chat_flow_log.py` captures turn lifecycle; `/v1/logs/chat-flow` endpoints expose the log over HTTP. (#46)
- **Per-phase wall-time instrumentation** — every pipeline phase records wall-clock durations for turn observability. (#51)
- **W3C traceparent injection** — `CogOSProvider` injects a W3C-compliant `traceparent` header; `trace_id` propagated through `chat_flow_log`. (#52)
- **`trace_id` propagation** — trace IDs flow through all phase events: `stt_capture`, `stt_transcribe`, `tts_synthesize`, `tts_playback_start`. (#58, #60)

### Added — CogOS modality node (RFC-0001)

- **Cog-native modality node scaffolding** — `modality.py`, Pipecat integration, and RFC-0001 design doc. (#27)
- **Typed API surfaces** — `schemas.http`, `schemas.ws_chat`, `schemas.ws_audio`. (#28)

### Added — MCP transport

- **HTTP-MCP mount at `/mcp`** — `install_mcp_route()` mounts FastAPI-native streamable-HTTP MCP transport; guarded against double-install. (#c05ed89, #9922d58)
- **`.mcp.json` switched to HTTP transport** — project-level MCP config updated to use the canonical HTTP path. (#f1cc22b)

### Changed

- **FastAPI lifespan migration** (`http_api.py`) — replaced all `@app.on_event("startup")` / `@app.on_event("shutdown")` decorators with a single `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan. Startup order: Kokoro warmup thread, kernel-bus bridge, CogOS agent bridge. Shutdown order: reverse. Eliminates the DeprecationWarning emitted on every boot. (#ba5e8e9)
- **Dashboard inference routed through CogOS kernel** — provider requests go to `/v1/chat/completions` on the kernel instead of in-process MLX. (#49)
- **Voice dropdown populated dynamically** from `/v1/voices`. (#48)
- **Version read from `pyproject.toml`** via `importlib.metadata` instead of a hardcoded constant. (#eebc588)
- **Generic example identifiers** in MCP tool schemas (scrubbed participant-specific examples). (#8, #9)

### Deprecated

- **stdio MCP transport (Phase 1 soft deprecation)** — `python server.py` (no args), `--all`, and `--channel` now emit a `DeprecationWarning` to stderr at boot. The stdio path remains fully functional; no behavior has changed. CLI `--help` text for `--all` and `--channel` notes the deprecation. HTTP-MCP (`python server.py --http`, connect via `/mcp`) is the canonical transport. Tracked in [#11](https://github.com/myrgic/mod3/issues/11); Phases 2–4 (flip default, retire `mcp_shim.py`, remove stdio) are separate future PRs. (#26, #f180d9fb)

### Fixed

- **Queue deadlock + Spark speed `KeyError`** — resolved a deadlock in queue stability and a missing-key error in Spark speed routing. (#20)
- **Kernel health endpoint URL** — corrected the URL used by the dashboard to check kernel health. (#68)
- **Channel-client 404** — `mod3_speak` in channel-client was calling the wrong endpoint; switched to `/v1/speak`. (#69)
- **Trace panel**: `trace_id` grouping, `turn_total` Gantt exclusion, kernel sub-span extraction. (#62)
- **Trace panel**: wall-clock Gantt, expand-state preservation, turn dedup. (#59)
- **Tracing**: propagate `trace_id` to all phase events; trace panel SSE and render. (#58)
- **Output**: `mode='audio'` now also emits text bubble to dashboard. (#61)
- **STT**: suppressed Whisper phrase-doubling via conditioning params and dedup backstop. (#50)
- **Bridge**: subscribes to per-bus SSE endpoint for agent responses. (#35)
- **Dashboard**: cycle trace removal, chat default to `/ws/chat`, ACP spec compliance. (#32)
- **Dashboard**: persist output device, close sink-timing race. (#08d679f)
- **Dashboard**: route WebSocket audio to the selected output device. (#7e441ee)
- **Dashboard**: audio WebSocket buffer must be `ArrayBuffer`, not `Uint8Array`. (#4da2533)
- **Dashboard**: serve `index.html` for `GET /dashboard/` (trailing slash). (#47)
- **Channels**: clean teardown on WebSocket disconnect. (#24)
- **MCP**: start MCP session manager during FastAPI lifespan (was missed on `--http` start). (#180d9fb)
- Various lint and formatting fixes (ruff).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added — Voice pipeline
- **Bidirectional voice pipeline** — full duplex audio (capture → STT → agent_loop → TTS → playback) with WebRTC echo cancellation
- **MCP shim** — bridges mod3 tools through cogos kernel as MCP tool surface
- **Bus-mediated dashboard chat** — dashboard chat goes through cogos kernel buses instead of in-process loop, so external observers see the same conversation events

### Added — Bargein provider registry
- **Pluggable `BargeinProvider` interface** (`bargein/providers/base.py`) — was a hardcoded SuperWhisper file watcher; now extensible
- **`SuperWhisperProvider`** (`bargein/providers/superwhisper.py`) — first provider, opt-in via `MOD3_BARGEIN_PROVIDERS=superwhisper`. Absorbs the SuperWhisper SQLite + filesystem detection logic that was previously drifting in a sibling repo
- **`BargeinRegistry`** (`bargein/__init__.py`) — registry + shared `handle_bargein_start()` helper, used by both legacy file watcher and provider dispatch
- **`BargeinRegistry.wait_for_event()`** — synchronous wait primitive used by `await_voice_input()` to block on in-process registry events
- New `"superwhisper"` value in `BargeinSource` literal

### Added — From earlier work, never released
- Queue-aware `speak()` returns with enriched metadata (PR #4)
- `SpeechQueue` for serial playback (thread-safe)
- User-state detection (held status when user is recording)
- `/v1/stop` HTTP endpoint for playback control
- `vad_check` MCP tool

### Changed
- Default `MOD3_BARGEIN_PROVIDERS=` (empty) preserves current behavior — no providers auto-start
- `await_voice_input()` now waits on both `BargeinRegistry` events AND legacy `/tmp/mod3-barge-in.json` for backward compat

### Fixed
- **Speaking lock ownership** — `(pid, job_id)`-aware with idempotent re-acquire. Two overlapping mod3 processes can no longer falsely interrupt each other.
- **Bus subscriber endpoint** — `KernelBusSubscriber` honors `COGOS_ENDPOINT` at call time (previously hardcoded `localhost:6931`)
- **Session-scoped reply routing** — kernel replies with `session_id` get routed to the matching browser channel; older payloads fall back to broadcast
- **Signal path unification** — `mcp_shim.py` reads from `/tmp/mod3-barge-in.json` (was orphan `~/.mod3_bargein_signal.json` that nobody wrote to)
- Held job zombie drain bug
- Pyright type errors in Gate abstract class
- Various ruff lint issues

### Reviewed by
- claude-opus-4-7 (interactive)
- gpt-5.4 (peer review, 3 passes)

### Notes on versioning
This release jumps from `v0.1.0` to `v0.4.0`. An earlier `v0.2.0` tag exists from before the org rename (no GitHub release was created). `v0.3.0` was bumped in `pyproject.toml` and added to the CHANGELOG but never tagged. `v0.4.0` captures everything since the last released version (`v0.1.0`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

  - `POST /v1/synthesize` — text → WAV/PCM audio bytes with full generation metrics
  - `POST /v1/audio/speech` — OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint
  - `POST /v1/vad` — Silero VAD speech detection on audio files
  - `POST /v1/filter` — Whisper hallucination check (Bag of Hallucinations)
  - `GET /v1/voices` — list engines and voice presets
  - `GET /v1/jobs` — job ledger with lifecycle tracking and per-chunk metrics
  - `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` — specific job details
  - `GET /health` — server health with engine/VAD status
- **Silero VAD** — voice activity detection input gate, prevents Whisper hallucinations on silence/noise
- **Bag of Hallucinations (BoH)** — post-filter for known Whisper phantom phrases ("thank you", "subscribe", etc.)
- **`vad_check` MCP tool** — run VAD on a local audio file from Claude Code
- **Job ledger** — every HTTP request (synthesize, VAD, filter) gets a job ID with full lifecycle timeline
- **Server startup modes** — `--http` (HTTP only), `--all` (MCP + HTTP), default MCP only
- **OpenClaw speech provider plugin** (`integrations/openclaw/`) — drop-in local TTS for Discord voice channels

### Changed
- **Engine extraction** — inference core moved to `engine.py`, shared by MCP and HTTP interfaces
- **Server refactored** — `server.py` imports from `engine.py` instead of defining models inline

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Non-blocking speech** — `speak()` returns immediately with job ID, audio plays in background

- **Separate `emotion` param** — Chatterbox exaggeration decoupled from speed
- **Job cleanup** — OrderedDict capped at 20 entries
- **200ms silence leader** — prevents audio device clipping first word

### Fixed

- Audio cut-off at end of speech (now uses `finished_callback`)
- Sample rate now model-aware (fixes Spark 16kHz calculations)
- README clone URL and tool signatures
